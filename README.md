# A.A.S. Capstone
My contribution to my group capstone project for my A.A.S.

This is a file dump of the backend demo for my final project in my A.A.S. degree. We were tasked with creating a website for the comic book store of the school's library, and my delegation was the backend.
The project ran on a WAMP server, running a MySQL database. The key feature was to upload and deliver blog post data to and from the database in the form of a "Latest News" page (the index) or the dedicated Blog page.
The full demo for this in action can be found here:
